       A person thinks of a word(ISOGRAM - A word with all unique letters), &amp; hosts the word for guessing. 
       You will be provided with the number of letters in the word. 
       You and every other player in the same room will start making guesses,
       the number of Cows &amp; Bulls in the word will be given for each guess. \n\n
       
Cows - The guessed word has letter/letters from the word hosted but at different positions.\n
Bulls - The guessed word has letters at the same position of the word that has been thought.\n\n


e.g. Say host thinks of a word "BOAT", hosts it and everyone else starts making their guesses.
You guess: "ENVY"
App will answer you as follows: COWS=0 (No similar letters at all) BULLS=0 (No letters in the same position)

You guess: "TOAD"
COWS-1 (Since the letter \'T\' is present in hosted word,but at different position than the word hosted, i.e. in the word "BOAT", the letter \'T\' is at  4th spot whereas it\'s at 1st position in word guessed.)
BULLS-2 (Since the letters \'O\' and \'A\' are present at the exact same positions as that of the word hosted)

Winner would be the one who gets it right (All BULLS). **BULLSEYE**</string>
